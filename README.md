eCommerce Sales Dashboard: A Power BI Deep Dive
Welcome! This project is a hands-on exploration of Power BI, where I built a comprehensive eCommerce sales dashboard from scratch. My focus was on creating a tool that not only looks great but is also powered by solid data foundations and logic.

This isn't just a simple chart collection. I used my skills to:

Build key performance indicators (KPIs): I designed and implemented crucial metrics like Total Profit, Total Sales, and Average Order Value (AOV) to provide an instant, high-level overview of the business's health.

Leverage DAX: The magic behind the numbers comes from Data Analysis Expressions (DAX). I used it to create custom measures that power the visualizations, from calculating month-over-month profit changes to segmenting sales by payment method. This allowed for a much deeper and more nuanced analysis.

Create actionable visualizations: The dashboard is built with a business user in mind. It includes intuitive charts that reveal patterns in sales, identify top-performing states and product categories, and even highlight monthly profit trends.

This project was a fantastic way to solidify my skills in data modeling, transformation, and creating impactful visualizations. It's a great example of how Power BI, when used correctly, can turn raw data into a powerful tool for business decision-making.
